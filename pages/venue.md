<b>Parking</b><br>
Drive onto the Pfizer entrance road, getting in the right lane.  The Pfizer security guard in the right-lane booth ("North Gate 1") will have a Visitor Badge for you.  Stop and tell the guard your name, that you are a visitor, here to attend the ASA Mini Conference, and show your ID.  (Note that f you arrive after 9:30am and there is a traffic cone in front of the right-lane booth indicating it’s closed, please use the left-lane booth.)

The guard will direct you to the parking garage, about 800 feet ahead, on your right.  Park on the top floor.  Look for signs that direct you to the elevator or stairs down to the second floor of the garage to a door where a Pfizer colleague will meet you, to walk you to the auditorium.
