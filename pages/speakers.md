<h4>Abstract</h4>

There has been an increasing interest in using real-world evidence (RWE) to support healthcare decision-making, drug development and regulatory submission in recent years. RWE provides useful insights to disease understanding, comparative effectiveness, treatment safety, data-driven clinical trial design and health economics. However, due to the high dimensionality, heterogeneity and sometimes sparsity of real-world data (RWD),  representation and modeling is challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI) is capable of handling these difficulties and extracting meaningful patterns from complex structured and unstructured data. AI includes a collection of machine learning and deep learning algorithms which have shown promising value and impressive results across a variety of disease areas. This presentation introduces general concepts and regulatory guidelines of RWE and AI in healthcare and drug development, detailed use cases are discussed to demonstrate design process and contribution to medical discovery. RWE and AI are transforming the way decisions are made in healthcare, facilitating evidence generation in the value chain of medical research and drug development.

Joshua Warren is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics at the Yale School of Public Health. He received his Ph.D. in statistics from North Carolina State University in 2011. Dr. Warren’s research focuses on statistical methods in public health with an emphasis on environmental health problems. Much of his work involves introducing spatial and spatiotemporal models in the Bayesian setting to learn more about associations between environmental exposures, such as air pollution, and various health outcomes including preterm birth, low birth weight, and congenital anomalies. He also has interest in developing and applying spatiotemporal models in collaborative settings such as epidemiology, geography, nutrition, and glaucoma research. His theoretical and methodological interests include multiple topics in spatial/spatiotemporal modeling and Bayesian nonparameterics.
