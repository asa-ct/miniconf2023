+ **Date/Time:** Friday, April 14, 2023
+ **Location:** The conference will be hybrid, with in-person sessions held in Pfize Research Site at Groton, CT and all sessions broadcast live via Zoom.

This annual event is organized by the [Connecticit Chapter of the Ameircan Statistical Association](https://community.amstat.org/connecticutchapter/home) (ASA-CT). We aim to 

+ engage our current and perspective members ASA;
+ discuss emerging topics in statistics;
+ provide a platform to connect statisticians and data scientists in the State of Connecticut and beyond.

The general scientific theme of this year's conference is on "information integration". This broadly refers to the merging and fusion of data or information from disparate sources to facilitate statistical inference and predictive modeling. Examples include leveraging historical data and real-world evidence, meta-analysis, transfer learning, federated learning, multi-modal data analysis, among others. We will have a diverse set of speakers to present related research topics and real-world applications.
