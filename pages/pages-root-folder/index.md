+ **Date/Time:** Friday, April 14, 2023
+ **Location:** The conference will be hybrid, with in-person sessions held at the Pfizer Research Site at Groton, CT and all sessions broadcast live via Zoom.

This annual event is organized by the [Connecticut Chapter of the American Statistical Association](https://community.amstat.org/connecticutchapter/home) (ASA-CT). We aim to 

+ engage our current and prospective ASA members;
+ discuss emerging topics in statistics and data science;
+ provide a platform to connect statisticians and data scientists in the State of Connecticut and beyond and to promote statistics and data science to the next generation. 

The general scientific theme of this year's conference is on "information integration". This broadly refers to the merging and fusion of data or information from disparate sources to facilitate statistical inference and predictive modeling. Examples include leveraging historical data and real-world evidence, meta-analysis, transfer learning, federated learning, multi-modal data analysis, among others. We will have a diverse set of speakers to present related research topics and real-world applications.
